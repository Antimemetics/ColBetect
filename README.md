# Conagraph

Here is an implementation of Conagraph, which implements contrastive
learning on aggregated log graph (ALG), building an ALG based on
action-based logs, implementing contrastive learning through maximiz-
ing mutual information to get the embeddings, and then detecting the
anomalies.

## Datasets

Considering the file size of the datasets, the datasets are not given here. We use 2 public datasets:

1. Kent, A.D.: Cyber security data sources for dynamic network research. In: Dynamic
Networks and Cyber-Security. pp. 37â€“65 (2016), https://www.worldscientific.com/
doi/abs/10.1142/9781786340757_0002
2. Lindauer, B.: Insider threat test dataset (2020), https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/
dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247

And a real-world dataset.
